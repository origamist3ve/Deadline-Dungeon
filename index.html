                <p id = tutorial> Welcome to Deadline Dungeon, a thrilling office-themed text adventure where you must navigate through a maze of mundane work scenarios! You start with 5 health and 0 suspicion, and your goal is to survive the office grind without falling into the pitfalls of office politics or losing your composure. Each room you enter presents a new situation, where you'll have to make choices that can affect your health and suspicion levels. If your health reaches 0 or your suspicion climbs to 5 before you reach the 7th room, you lose. But if you can make it through all 7 rooms while keeping your health intact and suspicion low, you win! Are you ready to tackle the deadlines, dodge the drama, and make it out unscathed? The dungeon awaits! </p>
